            <h1>How I Made the Website</h1>
            <p>This website was created with a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website was hosted on Github.</p>
            <h2>Steps I took to host my website on Github:</h2>
            <li>Login to <a href="https://github.com">Github</a></li>

            <li>Create a Github repository</li>
            <li>Clone the Github Repo outside of the folder containing all your files.</li>
            <li>Move the folder containing all your files into the Github Repo</li>
            <li>Add the files, commit, and push to Github</li>
            <li>Go to Settings and scroll until you get to the Github pages section.</li>
            <li>Copy and paste the link shown into a new browser tab. In my case: "krishna-tx.github.io"</li>
            <li>Voila! Now you have your website running completely free on the web.</li>
            
            <h2>I used the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">w3schools website</a> to get information on syntax for using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</h2>
            <h2>To see how I added JavaScript to change the background color with sliders, go to my <a href="https://github.com/krishna-tx/krishna-tx.github.io/tree/main/APCSP/html">Github repo</a></h2>
