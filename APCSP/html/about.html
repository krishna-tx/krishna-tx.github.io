            <h2>Hobbies</h2>
            <p>I enjoy spending my time doing various activities such as playing chess, basketball, and football.</p>
            <h3>Chess:</h3>
            <img src="images/chess.jpg" width="350">
            <p>I started playing chess when I was 5 years old. I have competed in many tournaments and overall I just enjoy the game. I usually play for fun online
                but occasionally I play with my little brother who's decent enough to give me a challenge.

            <h3>Basketball and football:</h3>

            <img src="images/football.jpeg" width="350">
            <p>I love to play and watch both professional basketball and football. I find it very entertaining to play with a lot of my friends and our games are 
                usually very competitive. Because of the pandemic, it has been harder to play like old times.
